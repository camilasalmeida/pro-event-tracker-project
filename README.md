### Potential Implementations
I would like to implement a recommendation function into the AAU app. This feature would provide users with event recommendations based on their interests and previous interactions, helping them discover new experiences. <br>
Additionally, as I continue my learning journey, I would like to introduce new and sophisticated features, design elements, and functionalities that reflect my professional growth and skills improvement.
